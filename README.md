Environment:
SSB Admin is compiled against and requires the released versions of .NET Framework 2.0 and SQL Server 2005. 

Most of the functionality of the application is implemented by the use of SQL Server Management Objects (SMO). However, SSBAdmin also uses some functionality from the ServiceBrokerInterface sample shipped with SQL Server 2005 (Engine Samples). 

Setup
To setup, the only thing you have to do is to copy the SsbAdmin directory to somewhere on your hard disk. Documentation can be found under SsbAdmin\docs.

Contact and Feedback
Any comments, suggestions etc. are very welcome. If someone wants to enhance the application, please get in touch. The mail address is niels.it.berglund@gmail.com.
